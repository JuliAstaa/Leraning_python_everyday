# change item in list, basicly same with ho to print spesific item
# ex: from list fruits = ['cocoa', 'banana', 'orange'] we want to change 'cocoa' to 'apple', as we know 'cocoa' at index, so to change 'cocoa' to 'apples' is fruits[0] = 'apple'

fruits = ['cocoa', 'banana', 'orange']
fruits[0] = 'apple'
print(fruits)
